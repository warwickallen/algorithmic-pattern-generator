- Each of the four corners start with a different hue.
- The hue at each corner slowly changes, moving around the colour wheel.
- The rate of change of the hue at each corner is independant of the other corners.
  Its period is the time taken to complete a full cycle of the colour wheel.
- The hue of any point between the corners is a linear interpolation of the current corner colours,
  based on the distance from the respective corners.
