## Unimplemented recommendations from `CODE_REUSE_REPORT.md`

- 13. Internationalisation Enhancement âœ… IMPLEMENTED

  - Extended `i18n` to handle dynamic content and attributes via `data-i18n-key` and `data-i18n-attr` (supports attributes like `title`, `aria-label`, etc.).
  - Added runtime APIs: `setTranslations(lang, map)` and `translateElement(el)`.
  - Integrated examples in `index.html` (`fps-label`, `learn-btn` tooltip/ARIA).
  - Tests: Added an i18n smoke test in `test-runner.js` validating dynamic key and attribute translation.

- 16. Memory Management Consolidation

  - Centralise cleanup via a `ResourceManager` with automatic tracking.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `ResourceManager` present; listener/manager cleanup appears distributed across modules.
  - Progress: `ResourceManager` added (not yet fully integrated across modules). Next: wire into `AlgorithmicPatternGenerator` and managers.

- 17. Animation Frame Management

  - Introduce `AnimationManager` for frame rate control and decoupled animation loops.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. `requestAnimationFrame` is invoked directly in `app.js` and `simulations.js`; no central animation controller exists.
  - Progress: `AnimationManager` added (scaffold). Next: integrate with simulation loops to control FPS centrally.

- 18. Statistics Collection Consolidation

  - Create `StatisticsCollector` with pluggable metrics across simulations.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `StatisticsCollector` found; stats are computed ad hoc where needed.
  - Progress: `StatisticsCollector` added. Next: feed metrics from simulations and PerformanceMonitor.

- 19. Canvas Management Consolidation

  - Add `CanvasManager` for common canvas setup and operations.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `CanvasManager` present; canvas/context handling is performed per simulation/component.
  - Progress: `CanvasManager` added. Next: use in app initialisation and simulation resize.

- 20. Keyboard Shortcut Management

  - Implement `KeyboardShortcutManager` with declarative configuration.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. Global `keydown` handlers are attached in `app.js`; no declarative shortcut mapping or centralised manager detected.
  - Progress: `KeyboardShortcutManager` added. Next: replace `KeyboardHandler` mapping with declarative manager or wrap it.

- 23. Logging Consolidation

  - Centralise logging to replace scattered `console.*` calls.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. Many `console.*` calls across the codebase; no unified logger. Could integrate with existing `ErrorHandler`.

  - Progress: Introduced lightweight `Logger` with levels; not yet fully integrated across modules. To be completed in a later iteration.

- 24. Type Checking Consolidation

  - Unify common runtime type checks/guards.
  - Relevance: Partially relevant. `config-validator.js` centralises schema validation for configs, but generic runtime type guards remain scattered throughout the code.

- 26. Test Helper Consolidation
  - Consolidate repeated test helpers into shared utilities.
  - Relevance: Mostly addressed. `test-utils.js` provides `TestUtilityFactory` used by tests; no duplicate `createMockCanvas`/`createMockContext` definitions found. Only minor tidy-ups may remain if any stray helpers exist.
