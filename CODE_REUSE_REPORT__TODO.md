## Unimplemented recommendations from `CODE_REUSE_REPORT.md`

- 13. Internationalisation Enhancement ✅ IMPLEMENTED

  - Extended `i18n` to handle dynamic content and attributes via `data-i18n-key` and `data-i18n-attr` (supports attributes like `title`, `aria-label`, etc.).
  - Added runtime APIs: `setTranslations(lang, map)` and `translateElement(el)`.
  - Integrated examples in `index.html` (`fps-label`, `learn-btn` tooltip/ARIA).
  - Tests: Added an i18n smoke test in `test-runner.js` validating dynamic key and attribute translation.

- 16. Memory Management Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial integration)

  - Centralise cleanup via a `ResourceManager` with automatic tracking.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `ResourceManager` present; listener/manager cleanup appears distributed across modules.
  - Integrated `ResourceManager` in `AlgorithmicPatternGenerator` for resize listeners, timeouts, intervals, and global cleanup.

- 17. Animation Frame Management ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial integration)

  - Introduce `AnimationManager` for frame rate control and decoupled animation loops.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. `requestAnimationFrame` is invoked directly in `app.js` and `simulations.js`; no central animation controller exists.
  - Wired `AnimationManager` into `BaseSimulation.start/pause` to drive the loop with FPS control; legacy path retained as fallback.

- 18. Statistics Collection Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial integration)

  - Create `StatisticsCollector` with pluggable metrics across simulations.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `StatisticsCollector` found; stats are computed ad hoc where needed.
  - Added global `statisticsCollector` and feed FPS samples from `PerformanceMonitor.monitorFPS()`.

- 19. Canvas Management Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial integration)

  - Add `CanvasManager` for common canvas setup and operations.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. No `CanvasManager` present; canvas/context handling is performed per simulation/component.
  - Used `CanvasManager.ensureAttachedSize()` on init and on resize in `AlgorithmicPatternGenerator`.

- 20. Keyboard Shortcut Management ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial integration)

  - Implement `KeyboardShortcutManager` with declarative configuration.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. Global `keydown` handlers are attached in `app.js`; no declarative shortcut mapping or centralised manager detected.
  - Added `KeyboardShortcutManager` and registered shortcuts; preserved legacy handler fallback.

- 23. Logging Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED (initial pass)

  - Centralise logging to replace scattered `console.*` calls.
  - Relevance: Still relevant. Many `console.*` calls across the codebase; no unified logger. Could integrate with existing `ErrorHandler`.

  - Implemented `Logger` routing for key logs in `app.js` (modal/system/perf) and `simulations.js` (lifecycle hooks, warnings). Included in test environment. Remaining scattered console usage in docs/tests intentionally left as-is.

- 24. Type Checking Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

  - Unify common runtime type checks/guards.
  - Implemented `TypeGuards` adoption at targeted call sites:
    - `app.js` `DynamicSpeedSlider` now uses `TypeGuards.toNumber` and `TypeGuards.clampNumber` for parsing/clamping, preventing NaN propagation and enforcing slider min/max; `handleRandomPattern` clamps coverage to 0–100.
    - Simulations already used `TypeGuards` for brightness/speed where available.
  - Tests: Existing smoke test in `test-runner.js` covers `TypeGuards`; UI/system tests pass with the stricter parsing.

- 26. Test Helper Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Consolidate repeated test helpers into shared utilities.
  - Adopted `TestUtilityFactory` in `tests/core/cell-toggle.test.js` to remove local canvas helper duplication, with a graceful fallback when factory is unavailable.
