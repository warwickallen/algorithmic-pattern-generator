# Project Guidelines

## Requirements Implementation
- Follow incremental iteration from REQUIREMENTS.md
- Implement one requirement at a time
- Follow Minimal Change Principle
- Document only essential information

## Development Approach
- Before suggesting changes: "Is this the minimal change needed?"
- Focus on working code over perfect solutions
- Test each implementation before moving to next
- Write tests for specific functionality being added

## Quality Gates
- Does this change directly address the stated requirement?
- Could this change be smaller while still achieving the goal?
- Are there any additions that aren't immediately necessary?

## Performance
- Optimise for smooth animations
- Minimise memory usage
- Ensure responsive user interface
- Test across different browsers and screen sizes

Remember: Create modular, or otherwise reusable code, wherever possible.
