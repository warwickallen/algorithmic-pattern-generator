# Likelihood Slider Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a likelihood slider next to the "Random" button that controls the probability of any particular cell being set to active when the random button is clicked. The "Clear" button has been removed as it's now redundant - clicking "Random" with the likelihood set to 0% achieves the same effect.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Changes (`index.html`)
- **Removed**: Clear button (`#clear-btn`)
- **Added**: Likelihood slider with label and value display
  - Slider range: 0-100%
  - Default value: 30%
  - Real-time value display showing percentage

### 2. CSS Changes (`styles.css`)
- **Added**: `#likelihood-value` to the list of value elements that share the same styling as other sliders

### 3. JavaScript Changes (`app.js`)

#### Removed:
- `clearSimulation()` method
- Clear button event handler registration
- Clear button element caching

#### Added:
- `setupLikelihoodSlider()` method to handle likelihood slider functionality
- Modified `handleRandomPattern()` to read likelihood value from slider and pass it to simulation randomize methods

#### Modified:
- Event listener setup to include likelihood slider initialization

### 4. Simulation Changes (`simulations.js`)

#### Modified all randomize methods to accept likelihood parameter:
- **Conway's Game of Life**: `randomize(likelihood = 0.3)`
- **Termite Algorithm**: `randomize(likelihood = 0.3)` 
- **Langton's Ant**: `randomize(likelihood = 0.5)`

#### Behavior:
- **0% likelihood**: All cells set to inactive (equivalent to old "Clear" functionality)
- **100% likelihood**: All cells set to active
- **Intermediate values**: Percentage of cells set to active based on likelihood

### 5. Internationalisation Changes (`i18n.js`)
- **Removed**: `clear-btn` translations from both `en-gb` and `en-us` language configurations

## Functionality

### Likelihood Slider
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Default**: 30%
- **Real-time updates**: Value display updates as slider is moved
- **Universal application**: Works across all simulations (Conway's Game of Life, Termite Algorithm, Langton's Ant)

### Random Button Behavior
- **With likelihood > 0%**: Creates random pattern with specified density
- **With likelihood = 0%**: Clears all cells (replaces old Clear button functionality)
- **With likelihood = 100%**: Fills all cells

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Intuitive control**: Users can directly control the density of random patterns
2. **Reduced UI clutter**: Removed redundant Clear button
3. **Consistent interface**: Same slider pattern used across all controls
4. **Immediate feedback**: Real-time value display shows current setting

## Testing
A test file (`test-likelihood-slider.html`) has been created to verify:
- Likelihood slider functionality
- Clear button removal
- Random button behavior with different likelihood values

## Benefits
1. **More intuitive**: Users can directly control pattern density
2. **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant Clear button
3. **Consistent**: Same interaction pattern across all simulations
4. **Flexible**: Fine-grained control over random pattern generation
5. **Backward compatible**: Default 30% likelihood maintains original behavior
