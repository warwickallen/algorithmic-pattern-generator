# Test Suite Organisation Summary

## Overview
The test suite has been reorganised from 4 categories to 8 categories to provide better logical grouping and more granular test execution options.

## New Test Categories

### 1. Simulation Core Tests (`simulation-core`)
**Purpose**: Tests fundamental simulation functionality that all simulations must have.

**Tests include**:
- Simulation creation (Conway, Termite, Langton)
- Grid initialization
- Basic cell toggling
- Neighbour counting (Conway)
- Entity movement (Termite, Langton)

**Rationale**: These are the core algorithms and data structures that make each simulation work. They test the essential mathematical and logical foundations.

### 2. Simulation Features Tests (`simulation-features`)
**Purpose**: Tests additional features and capabilities that enhance the simulations.

**Tests include**:
- Termite slider functionality (dynamic termite count)
- Brightness application
- DRY implementation (code reuse patterns)
- Speed setting

**Rationale**: These features enhance the user experience but aren't core to the simulation algorithms themselves.

### 3. User Interface Tests (`ui`)
**Purpose**: Tests UI components and management systems.

**Tests include**:
- Configuration manager
- Shared components (sliders, etc.)
- Performance optimizer utilities
- Element cache
- Event listener manager
- Control management
- Modal management
- Learn modal content verification

**Rationale**: These test the UI framework and component systems that provide the interface layer.

### 4. User Interaction Tests (`interaction`)
**Purpose**: Tests user interaction patterns and mouse/keyboard handling.

**Tests include**:
- Drag cell toggling
- Drag coordinate fixes
- Keyboard handler
- Controls visibility timing

**Rationale**: These specifically test how users interact with the application through input devices.

### 5. Performance Tests (`performance`)
**Purpose**: Tests performance characteristics and optimization.

**Tests include**:
- Grid creation performance
- Cell counting performance
- Drawing performance
- Update performance

**Rationale**: These ensure the application meets performance requirements and identify bottlenecks.

### 6. Integration Tests (`integration`)
**Purpose**: Tests how different components work together.

**Tests include**:
- Simulation switching
- State preservation
- Full simulation lifecycle
- Termite slider integration

**Rationale**: These test the integration points between different parts of the system.

### 7. Visual Effects Tests (`visual`)
**Purpose**: Tests visual rendering and effects.

**Tests include**:
- Fade-to-black effect
- Comprehensive fade functionality
- Visual regression testing

**Rationale**: These ensure the visual output is correct and effects work as intended.

### 8. System Tests (`system`)
**Purpose**: Tests system-level concerns and debugging.

**Tests include**:
- Console warning detection
- Test canvas configuration
- Fade progression debug

**Rationale**: These test system health, debugging capabilities, and test environment setup.

## Benefits of New Organisation

### 1. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- Core algorithm tests are separate from feature tests
- UI tests are separate from interaction tests
- Visual effects are in their own category

### 2. **More Granular Test Execution**
- Developers can run specific types of tests (e.g., just performance tests)
- Easier to identify which area has issues
- Faster feedback for specific concerns

### 3. **Clearer Test Purpose**
- Each category has a clear, single responsibility
- Tests are grouped by what they're testing, not just where they're implemented
- Easier to understand what each test category validates

### 4. **Improved Maintenance**
- Easier to find related tests
- Clearer where to add new tests
- Better organisation for test documentation

## Migration from Old Categories

| Old Category | New Categories | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| `core` | `simulation-core`, `simulation-features`, `interaction`, `visual`, `system` | Split based on what was actually being tested |
| `ui` | `ui`, `interaction` | Separated UI components from user interactions |
| `performance` | `performance` | No change - already well-defined |
| `integration` | `integration`, `visual`, `system` | Split based on test purpose |

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Run all tests
runAllTests();

// Run only core simulation algorithms
runSimulationCoreTests();

// Run only UI component tests
runUITests();

// Run only performance tests
runPerformanceTests();

// Run only visual effects tests
runVisualTests();
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Test Naming**: Consider prefixing test names with category abbreviations for even clearer organisation
2. **Category Descriptions**: Add descriptions to each category in the UI
3. **Test Counts**: Show test counts per category in the summary
4. **Category-Specific Settings**: Allow different timeout or retry settings per category
